\
\ This project contains a file system written for Forth systems
\ that uses Forth Blocks as the mechanism to store and retrieve
\ data meaning that this file should be fairly portable.
\
\ ## Format
\
\ The disk format consists of a series of 1024 byte, aligned,
\ Forth Blocks. The format is optimized to work with Forth
\ blocks and it is expected that a Forth interpreter is
\ available to execute files if needed.
\
\ Formerly the file system consisted of a maximum of 512 
\ blocks, which is the maximum number of 16-byte entries that 
\ can fit in a single block. This limited the maximum file 
\ system size to 512KiB. Now multiple blocks can be used to
\ store the FAT table meaning this file system can store
\ up to 64MiB of data (less some overhead and some blocks that
\ cannot be used).
\
\ The FAT is stored as a binary file. Directories are fixed
\ format text files. Files consist of potentially non
\ contiguous Forth Blocks, and thus files must be multiples
\ of 1024 bytes when allocating space to them (that is a file
\ that occupies 3 bytes of space must take up 1024 bytes,
\ excluding the directory entry itself).
\
\ The file system is designed to be forwards compatible to
\ a degree with various potential changes, or at least offer
\ a possible avenue for an upgrade.
\
\ The file system and utilities are designed for a single
\ user system. This is due to the fact that global variables
\ are used (this could be alleviated by using USER variables)
\ and there is no locking. There is currently no way to 
\ allocate another set of variables to mount a second file
\ system.
\
\ ### FAT - File Allocation Table
\
\ The FAT, or File Allocation Table, is a data-structure at
\ the heart of this file system. It was contained in a single
\ Forth block in this version of the file system and consisted
\ of 512 16-bit entries (which limits this file system 512KiB).
\ It now spans multiple blocks, upping the file system limit
\ to 64MiB. The FAT blocks have to be stored in a contiguous
\ fashion, the first of which is stored after the boot block.
\
\ After the last FAT block the first directory is stored.
\
\ The number of FAT blocks required for a file system is
\ the number of blocks allocated to that file system divided
\ by 512 and rounded up to the next block (e.g we need one
\ FAT block to store 1, 512, or 6 FAT entries, and we need two
\ to store 513 or 1024 FAT entries). There must be at least one
\ FAT block.
\
\ Each 16-bit entry is either a special value or a node in a
\ linked list of entries terminating in a special value.
\
\ Special values include; This block is free, this block is
\ bad (an error occurred reading or writing that block), this
\ block is unmapped (if fewer than 512 blocks are available in
\ any FAT block), or this block is special for some other 
\ reason (for example that block holds the FAT itself, the 
\ initial directory or the boot block). The use of special
\ values has largely been removed, even for FAT blocks,
\ instead a linked list is used and other means are used to
\ prevent those blocks from being freed or reallocated. This
\ allows the command line tools to be used to inspect those
\ data-structures if a special file is constructed that points
\ to them using `mknod`.
\
\ The block entry stored in the FAT table does not necessarily
\ directly correspond to the actual block number as stored on
\ disk. An offset is applied which is useful when the Forth
\ implementation is mapped on to some of the blocks or certain
\ blocks have special meaning (usually the 0 block) and cannot
\ be used.
\
\ The FAT is simply a linked list, it can be traversed in one
\ direction only (at least easily) which can slow down seeking.
\ It would be possible to speed this operation up by copying
\ the FAT into a different in memory data structure and syncing
\ that to disk when needed, this is not done as it adds
\ complexity and increases RAM usage. We could have also used
\ a XOR linked list (see the following Wikipedia article:
\ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list>) in order
\ to speed up traversing the list in both directions, this
\ would have added unneeded complexity.
\
\ In order to traverse a linked list in reverse order a pointer
\ to the head of the list is needed. We can get to the previous
\ pointer by linking each node until we get to the current
\ node in the link, the link prior to this then becomes our
\ new position. This is an expensive operation, but not too
\ expensive and seeking like this should not be needed.
\
\ FAT-12, FAT-16 and FAT-32 are much more complex than this
\ file system, one more complexity of them is that they store
\ multiple copies of the entire FAT data-structure, often
\ just two, allowing recovery on failure of the main FAT
\ table. As there are only two copies there is no definitive
\ way of telling which one is correct however.
\
\ ### Text Directory Format
\
\ The directory format is incredibly simple, it consists of
\ fixed width text fields that are human and machine readable.
\
\        \ DIRNAME         BLK
\        F FILE.FTH        BLK
\        F FILE.TXT        BLK
\        D DIRECTORY       BLK
\        S FILE.SPC        BLK
\
\ The fields are:
\
\ * Directory entry type, which is two bytes in size.
\ * A file name which is 16 bytes in size.
\ * A block field which is 5 bytes in size.
\
\ The directories must be stored in a compact fashion with no
\ gaps, this matters when entries are removed from the 
\ directory.
\
\ The first entry in a directory contains a special 32-byte
\ field. It has the directory entry type of "\". It contains
\ a copy of the directories name which is used when printing
\ out the present working directory with `pwd`.
\
\ All other directory entries are also 32-bytes in size, 
\ 23 bytes are currently used. Non used bytes must be set to 
\ the space ASCII character.
\
\ File and directory names are 16-bytes in length always, even 
\ when the directory entry is a file name like "ABC.TXT", when 
\ stored as a directory entry the file is padded with trailing 
\ spaces up to the 16 byte limit. The file name is not 
\ separated into file-name and file-extension with an implied
\ "." like in FAT-12, FAT-16 or FAT-32.
\
\ The "BLK" fields are formatted as 16-bit unsigned hexadecimal 
\ numbers with a "$" prefix. They are the initial entries in a
\ FAT table, which may point to a FAT linked list, a special
\ block, or a sentinel value in the case that the file is a
\ single block in size.
\
\ All files must have associated blocks assigned to them, even
\ empty files. This may change in the future. That is a file
\ with a size of zero bytes in size has one backing block, 
\ much like a file with a 1024, 6, or 1000 bytes assigned to
\ it.
\
\ Directories consist of a single block, which limits their
\ size. This may change in the future.
\
\ Thirty one directory entries can fit in a single directory, 
\ which is not shown above as each entry being 32 bytes two 
\ entries fill and entire line which would push the line length 
\ over 64 in this document.
\
\ ### File Format
\
\ A file consists of a entry in a directory and a linked list
\ of blocks in the FAT. All files in this version of the file
\ system must be multiples of 1024 bytes in size. Files do not
\ not have to consist of a contiguous set of blocks, which 
\ marks the major advantage of this file system over 
\ traditional ways of managing Forth blocks.
\
\ Special files are marked with an "S" instead of an "F", many
\ but not all utilities will work with these files, and editing
\ these special files may cause instability.
\
\ ### Special Blocks
\
\ There are at least three special blocks, a boot block, a
\ FAT table, and the root directory. They are the first three
\ blocks in the file system.
\
\ ### Commands
\
\ The commands are implemented as a series of Forth words that
\ use parsing words to take their arguments from the input
\ stream if they have any, that is they do not expect their
\ arguments to be present on the stack.
\
\ There is a help and list of commands that is compiled into
\ the example image that is created at the end of this file,
\ along with an example executable program.
\
\ Commands take their names from Unix and MS-DOS, for example
\ both "ls" and "dir" are present (although they behave
\ slightly differently).
\
\ ### Block Editor
\
\ A block editor is included that works on files stored in a
\ non-contiguous fashion. It can also grow files. The editor
\ commands consist of single or double letter commands, it
\ is described later on, in a help file that is created on
\ disk.
\
\ ## Future Direction
\
\ As with any project there are many things that could be done,
\ only some of which will, writing down these potentialities
\ can be a sort of catharsis in lieu of doing the actual work
\ to resolve them. As to what can be done we could; implement
\ more commands, refactor many of the words, improve error 
\ handling and detection, calculate fragmentation and offer a 
\ way to defragment the file system, perform error checking on 
\ the file systems data-structures and orphaned nodes, offer a 
\ way to securely erase files, perhaps add checksums on the
\ file systems data structures and files, make a utility in C 
\ for manipulating the file system and importing and exporting 
\ files to it, allow zero length files, add more file system 
\ meta-data, rewrite `list` so we have more control over how 
\ things look like, make a better more DOS like shell, 
\ differing blocks sizes, a primitive journal just temporary 
\ FAT directories and more. 
\
\ The following provides a way to calculate fragmentation:
\ <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4586972>, which will be
\ very slow on the SUBLEQ system.
\
\ Checksums, as mentioned, could be added to the file system
\ to give some guarantee that the data has not been corrupted.
\ If it were to be added adding it to the FAT, then to each
\ directory, and then to each file. Adding checksums to the
\ FAT would be easy, and little effort, adding to directories
\ still fairly easy, and to files it would involve a higher
\ effort, but more importantly the file systems performance
\ would suffer when writing data.
\
\ Some file system features there is no intention to ever
\ implement (such as hard or symbolic links), partly due to
\ file system limitations and partly due to a lack of need.

\ This would be useful in conjunction with pseudo
\ files (Special Files with a pointer to a variable containing

\ could make a file that spat out random data when read, or
\ acted like it was always full, or contained infinite zeros.
\
\ It would also allow us to remove the special cases of

\ ### Include/Require
\
\ `entry` and `required?` are used by `included`, `include`,
\ `require` and `required` in order to prevent loading the
\ same file twice when using `require` or `required`. They do
\ this by adding a word to a wordlist that has the same
\ name as the file being executed, this wordlist can be checked
\ by future calls to `required?`.
\       
wordlist constant {required}
\ This prints out the files that have been `included` or
\ `required` in the past.
\
\        : .require 
\          get-order {required} 1 set-order words set-order ;
\
\ This really should turn a file name into a canonical file
\ name and then remember that.

\ ## Utility Helper Functions
\
\ We can now build utilities using these File Access Methods,
\ along with more primitive ways of directly accessing the
\ file system. We are free to mix and match here. There is
\ no real structure to this section, there is a menagerie of
\ helping words, often one per command that will be implemented
\ later, for example `(cmp)` is used to implement the command
\ `cmp`.

\ ## Block Editor
\
\ This implements a block editor that operates on discontinuous 
\ blocks. SUBLEQ eForth contains a block editor that operates
\ on continuous blocks if one is needed, as it allows the
\ blocks to be directly addressed which is hidden from the
\ user with this editor.
\
\ There is a help section later on in this file for this 
\ editor. New blocks will be automatically allocated as needed.
\
\ A line oriented editor could be made as we have the file
\ access words to do so now.
\
\ All the editor commands are contained within their own
\ `{edlin}` vocabulary.
\
\ A command to delete the current working block would be 
\ useful, instead of the `r` command which is a poor facsimile.
\
\ In order to lock the file we are editing we open up a file
\ handle using `open-file` later when we call `edlin` and store
\ it in `flock`. Otherwise the File Access Methods are not used
\ for editing.

\ ### Easy File Creation
\
\ This subsection of DOS commands introduces a syntax that
\ allows the creation of new files, both textual and binary,
\ so long as no editing is required. Instead of a simple
\ command that performs an action several words are created 
\ that work in conjunction.
\
\ `file:` and `append:` are defined first for textual files:
\
\ Usage:
\
\      file: example.txt
\      | March on, join bravely, let us to it pell mell, if not
\      | to heaven then hand in hand to hell!
\      ;file
\
\ And to append to a file:
\
\      append: example.txt
\      |
\      | More Shakespeare!
\      |
\      ;append
\
: file: -handle token count w/o recreate-file throw handle ! ;
: append: -handle token count w/o append-file throw handle ! ;
: ;file handle @ close-file -handle throw ;
: ;append ;file ;
: | 
  handle @ 0< if discard exit then
  leftovers handle @ write-line ?dup if ;file then discard ;
\
\ `hex:` works slightly differently, it allows the creation of
\ binary files byte by byte. Once `hex:` and a file name has
\ been entered a series of hexadecimal numbers can be entered.
\ The sequence can be terminated with a `.` (or any non
\ numeric sequence).
\
\ Usage:
\
\        hex: file.bin
\        0 1 2 3 AA FF
\        01 20
\        .
\
: hex: ( "file" -- )
  token count w/o recreate-file throw
  base @ >r hex
  cr
  >r
  begin
    integer dpl @ 0< and
  while
    r@ emit-file drop
  repeat drop
  r> close-file r> base ! throw ;

\ ### File Compression
\
\ `lzp` and `unlzp` are commands that perform file compression.
\ The compression routine has already been described, it is
\ fairly poor in terms of compression performance but it is
\ simple and can save about 20% of the files size, one some
\ types of file it can save a lot more (especially files
\ formatted as Forth blocks).
\
{lzp} +order
: lzp ( "from" "to" -- )
  peekd locked!? ro? 
  narg namebuf mcopy narg movebuf namebuf lzp-file-name 
  lzp-statistics ;
: unlzp ( "from" "to" -- ) 
  peekd locked!? ro? 
  narg namebuf mcopy narg movebuf namebuf unlzp-file-name
  lzp-statistics ;
{lzp} -order

\ ### Missing Commands
\
\ `chkdsk` and `defrag` are missing. These would be complex
\ commands for interactively repairing broken disks and
\ for defragmenting the disk respectively.
\
\ Defragmentation can be performed in a crude way be using
\ `export` to export the entire file system and then importing
\ that to a fresh file system. It is not ideal, but it is
\ much simpler than implementing a defragmentation routine.
\
\ To defragment the file system free space is required,
\ files would have to be moved to the free blocks and placed
\ back in a more ordered sequence in the holes left over from
\ moving files around, multiple passes might be required to
\ fully defragment the system. It is a slow process, the
\ Wikipedia page on the subject has more information, see
\ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defragmentation>.
\
\ For a `chkdsk` or Check Disk routine some recovery routines
\ could be done semi-automatically. User intervention is 
\ needed to decided on what to do with broken files. This
\ file system is non journalling, and although checksums can
\ be calculated over the various data structures in the file
\ system they are not automatically applied but instead used
\ for a manual check of system integrity.
\
\ There are some basic checks that can be done:
\
\ 1. For the FAT partition a check that all pointers are within
\ bounds. Checks can be performed that boot and root directory
\ are also present, and the root directory looks okay (for
\ example no non-ASCII characters should be present in a
\ directory entry, the directory header should be present, 
\ etcetera).
\ 2. If there are orphaned blocks, these can be collected
\ together. There is unfortunately no way to determine which
\ file an orphaned block belongs to, nor if the block was
\ actually a directory entry. A file could be created for each
\ orphaned chain.
\ 3. For each directory entry in all the directories a check 
\ that there is a corresponding FAT entry.
\ 4. For all files and directories check that no files overlap 
\ (use the same blocks).
\ 5. Bad blocks could be tested for.
\
\
\ There are many more checks that could be thought of and
\ implemented, the complexity of this command has no upper
\ bound. At some point it would become easier and more reliable
\ to add journaling to the file system instead.
\
\ ### Aliases
\
\ Aliases for commands have been added, some have been
\ avoided because they clash with Forth words. Common
\ synonyms from Unix and DOS have been added to make 
\ programmers familiar with either system more comfortable, and
\ to lessen the impact of tripping over muscle memory on a new
\ platform.
\
\ Adding an alias is as simple as adding a new word definition.
\
: chdir cd ; ( "dir" -- change Present Working Directory )
: cls page ; ( -- : clear screen )
: cp copy ; ( "file" "file" -- copy file )
: del rm ; ( "file" -- delete file )
: ed edit ; ( "file" -- edit file )
: touch mkfile ; ( "file" -- : create a file )
: diff cmp ; ( "file" "file" -- : compare two files )
( : sh script ; ( "file" -- execute file ) \ Clashes in Gforth
( : bye halt ; ) \ Clashes with FORTHs `bye`word.
( : exit halt ; ) \ Clashes with FORTHs `exit` word.
( : quit halt ; ) \ Clashes with FORTHs `quit` word.
( : move mv ; ) \ Clashes with FORTHs `move` word.
( : type cat ; ) \ Clashes with FORTHs `type` word.

| FORTH FILE SYSTEM HELP AND COMMANDS
|
| Author: Richard James Howe
| Repo:   https://github.com/howerj/ffs
| Email:  howe.r.j.89@gmail.com
|
| This is a simple DOS like file system for FORTH, it makes
| it easier to edit and manipulate data than using raw blocks.
|
| For more information see:
|
| <https://github.com/howerj/ffs>
| <https://github.com/howerj/subleq>
|
| To simplify the implementation only the `move` command can
| move files and directories into other directories, `move`
| also handles targets "." and "..", like `cd` does.
|
| To execute a file type `sh <FILE>` or `exe <FILE>`.
|
| Commands:
|
| b2f <FILE1> <FILE2>: convert block files to line/byte files
| bcat <FILE>: display a series of blocks
| bgrep <STRING> <FILE>: Search for <STRING> in <FILE> blocks
| bmore <FILE>: display a file, pause for each block
| cat <FILE>: display a file
| cd / chdir <DIR>: change working directory to <DIR>
| cksum <FILE>: Compute and print CRC (16-bit CCITT) of file
| cls: clear screen
| cmp / diff <FILE> <FILE>: compare two files
| cp / copy <FILE1> <FILE2>: copy <FILE1> to new <FILE2>
| deltree <FILE/DIR>: delete a file, or directory recurisvely
| df: display file system information
| ed / edit <FILE>: edit a <FILE> with the block editor
| exe <FILE>: execute source <FILE> of blocks
| export: export (or dump), from pwd, the file system
| f2b <FILE1> <FILE2>: convert line/byte files to block files
| fallocate <FILE> <NUM>: make <FILE> with <NUM> blocks
| fdisk: **WARNING** formats disk deleting all data!
| fgrow <FILE> <NUM>: grow <FILE> by <NUM> blocks
| freeze: Freeze file system - Turn on read only mode
| fsync: save any block changes
| ftruncate <FILE> <NUM>: truncate <FILE> to <NUM> blocks
| grep <STRING> <FILE>: Search for <STRING> in lines of <FILE>
| help: display a short help
| hexdump <FILE>: hexdump a file consisting of blocks
| login: password login (NOP if no users) (SUBLEQ eForth only)
| ls / dir : list directory
| lsuser: List all users in login system (SUBLEQ eFORTH only)
| lzp <FILE1> <FILE2>: LZP Compress <FILE1> into <FILE2>
| melt: Unfreeze file system - Turn off read only mode
| mkdir <DIR>: make a directory
| mknod <FILE> <NUM>: make a special <FILE> with <NUM>
| mkrandom <FILE> <BYTES>: file <FILE> with random <BYTES>
| mkuser <USER> <PASSWORD>: create new user entry (SUBLEQ only)
| more <FILE>: display a file, pause for every X lines
| mount: attempt file system mounting
| pwd: print current working directory
| rename <DIR/FILE1> <DIR/FILE2>: rename a file or directory
| rm / del <FILE>: remove a <FILE> and not a <DIR>
| rmdir <DIR>: remove an empty directory
| sh / script <FILE>: execute line based <FILE>
| sh / shell: invoke file system shell
| stat <FILE>: display detailed information on <FILE>
| touch / mkfile <FILE>: make a new file
| tree: recursively print directories from the current one
| unlzp <FILE1> <FILE2>: LZP Decompress <FILE1> into <FILE2>
| wc <FILE>: display byte, word and line count of a file
| yes <FILE> <STR> <NUM>: fill <FILE> with <NUM> lines of <STR>
| 
| `grep` is limited to 16 byte search terms and 1024 byte 
| lines, it also uses the same copy buffer that the editor
| uses for the copy command.
| 
| Executing files requires that they are block formatted and
| not line formatted. 
| 
| Example commands:
|
| mkdir test
| cd test
| edit HELLO.FTH
| 0 i .( HELLO, WORLD ) cr
| s q
| exe HELLO.FTH
| rm HELLO.FTH
| ls
| 
| To make new files the words `file:` and `hex:` can be used
| to create text files and binary files respectively.
|
| Example usage of `file:`:
|
|        file: example.txt
|        | This is an example line, line #1
|        | This is an example line, line #2
|        ;file
|
| This will create a file called `example.txt` with the two
| line, without the `|` prefix.
|
| To create a binary file using `hex:`:
|
|        hex: example.bin
|        0 1 2 3 AA FF
|        3 4 5 6
|        .
| 
| EDITOR COMMANDS
|
| This block editor is primitive but usable. It operates on
| 1024 byte Forth blocks, with 16 lines per block. Some 
| commands accept a line number or position.
| q : quit editor
| s : save work
| n : move to next block in file, allocating one if needed
| p : move to previous block in file
| + <LINE>: insert <LINE>, advance line count, 'n' if needed
| - : decrement line count, call 'p' if needed, no <LINE>
| x : execute current file from the start
| #line d : delete #line
| l : list current block we are editing
| w : list commands available to the editor
| #line a / i <LINE>: insert <LINE> onto #line of current block
| #line #row ia <LINE>: insert <LINE> into #line at #row
| ? : display current block
| z : blank current block
| y : yank block to storage buffer
| u : replace screen with storage buffer
| r : remove last block in chain, set working block to first
|
| Note that it is possible to delete a file whilst editing it,
| which is not advised but should not break anything.
|
| When editing a file with `edit` if the file does not exist
| it is created.
|
| A typical session might look like:
|
| edit hello.fth
| 0 i \ HELLO WORLD PROGRAM, VERSION #666, RJH, 15/04/2024
| 1 i .( AHOY THERE WORLD, SALUTATIONS AND WARM GREETINGS ) cr
| s
| q
| exe hello.fth
|
| This is a block editor, and not a freeform text editor, so
| it does follow a strict format of 16 lines of text per block.
|
| "p" and "n" can be used to move forward and backward in the
| file, a new block is assigned if "n" is at the end of the
| file.
